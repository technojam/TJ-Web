TechnoJAM, the technology community of the School of Computer Science and Engineering Galgotias University 
was established in 2015 with the aim of working on a variety of new projects that will give minds to creative thinking patterns for future developers.

It is a community to promote and coordinate research and development through students, through student industry partnerships that 
give students the freedom and opportunities to work in a variety of technological fields, and, in turn, pursue their ideas to become innovators. 
To improve the technical intelligence of our institutional students, we organize conferences, Workshops, Hackathons, Techfest and many other competitions at
various technical levels to attract students' interest in the technical aspects of their education.
